# Day 2

Step 1:
In day 2 I firstly learnt about the difference between FP and TP, FP referring to false protocol and TP referring to True Protocol.
Step 2:
I was given a website URL and had to login to that.
Then on the website had to hover to the discover tab where I had to set the calendar to some specific dates ie 1st december 9 to 9:30.
Step 3:
Now in this time period I had to add some specific columns which were going to be the ones which I had to search upon, because these were the ones which were probably exploited.
