# Day 2

Step 1:
In day 2 I firstly learnt about the difference between FP and TP, FP referring to false protocol and TP referring to True Protocol.
Step 2:
I was given a website URL and had to login to that.
Then on the website had to hover to the discover tab where I had to set the calendar to some specific dates ie 1st december 9 to 9:30.
Step 3:
Now in this time period I had to add some specific columns which were going to be the ones which I had to search upon, doing this would make the job easier as searching within these columns would possibly reveal the attackers intentions.



As instructed I added the field columns which the website told me to add.

Step 4:
Then I added souce.ip to the column list as well to see which from which IP address the most traffic had been accumulated on the website.
Now the dates didnt lead to enough discoveries, so I changed the dates from 29th November to 1st December as instructed.
This gave me alot more traffic than before.
Now I entered the specific ip address 10.0.11.11 as that was the ip address which had the most traffic.
Now doing some more changes as instructed by the website, I received all the answers which were needed.

Step 5:

1) The name of the account came from looking at the data and seeing which data had most traffic.
2) For failed login attempts, the event.outcome was supposed to be set to failure which gave the answer as 6791
3) The IP address of glitch was obtained by looking at the column of different IP addresses.
4) For the successful login attempt, the even.outcome was set to successful and user was set to ADM-01


Learnings:
1) Getting to know the difference and meaning of FP and TP
2) Filtering out differents sorts of data for inspection of attacks.
