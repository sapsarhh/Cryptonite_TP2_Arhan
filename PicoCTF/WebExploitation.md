Step 1:
This challenge was done by a classic way of hit and trial and also with the use of burpsuite intercept.
So in this question I opened the website and firstly I just did random nonsense and put random cookie names like arhan and checked out what was happening.
It gave me an error that it was an invalid cookie name.
Step 2:
Then I tried the placeholder value which was snickerdoodle and it told me that wasnt a special cookie but still accepted it.
Now I was confused on what to do.
Step 3:
Now on the home page I inspected the web page and saw that there was a cookie name=0 value and when I entered something invalid that name changed to -1 but when I entered something invalid it changed that to some number like with snickerdoodle it got changed to 1.
Turned back to 0 when I came back to the home page.
Now I used some other cookie name like gingerbread and observed that the value again changed, now this time to 23.
Step 4:
This told me that different cookie names had different values and maybe the flag could be retrieved with different values.
Step 5:
Now I used burpsuite intercept which I learnt from a video as well as the intro to burp easy challenge on the website, and using that I kept changing the value which was hit and trial and finally got the flag on the 18th cookie value.

The following are the screenshots which I got from burpsuite and its browser respectively.

In the cookie name I changed the values like when I did 2 it gave me something like oatmeal cookies.
