Step 1:
This challenge was done by a classic way of hit and trial and also with the use of burpsuite intercept.
So in this question I opened the website and firstly I just did random nonsense and put random cookie names like arhan and checked out what was happening.
It gave me an error that it was an invalid cookie name.
Step 2:
Then I tried the placeholder value which was snickerdoodle and it told me that wasnt a special cookie but still accepted it.
Now I was confused on what to do.
Step 3:
Now on the home page I inspected the web page and saw that there was a cookie name=0 value and when I entered something invalid that name changed to -1 but when I entered something invalid it changed that to some number like with snickerdoodle it got changed to 1.
Turned back to 0 when I came back to the home page.
Now I used some other cookie name like gingerbread and observed that the value again changed, now this time to 23.
Step 4:
This told me that different cookie names had different values and maybe the flag could be retrieved with different values.
Step 5:
Now I used burpsuite intercept which I learnt from a video as well as the intro to burp easy challenge on the website, and using that I kept changing the value which was hit and trial and finally got the flag on the 18th cookie value.

The following are the screenshots which I got from burpsuite and its browser respectively.

In the cookie name I changed the values like when I did 2 it gave me something like oatmeal cookies.

Learnings:
A) Learnt about the use of burpsuite intercept and how it is so important in the world of web exploitation.

## Forbidden Paths

Step 1:
In this question I was told that I had to read the flag.txt file but the website was filtering out files using their absolute paths.
Now firstly I inspected the home page didnt find anything, then I again used burp to try and intercept something, no luck with that.
Step 2:
Then I entered flag.txt just to check what would happen and it told me that was an invalid file name and didnt do anything further.
Went back and enter the 3 different file names given and they worked of course but didnt really get any clue from those.
Step 3:
Then I tried the .. name and that gave nothing at all which was kind of a clue in itself because the .. was actually used to go back to the previous directory like its done in the Ubuntu Terminal.
Step 4:
Then I tried to read the flag file using its relative path which was ./flag.txt and to my surprise the error which I got this time was that I didnt have the authority to view this file.
Step 5:
That is when I realize that the directory given in the question was actually the path in which I was currently located and I needed to go back to the home directory because that is where the flag.txt file was located and I could read it from there.
Boom that was it so I used the following command to simuntaneously go back to the home directory as well as reading the flag.txt.
../../../../flag.txt
the 4 slashes have been used because I was currently in /usr/share/nginx/html so I needed to go back 4 directories basically to go to the home directory.
This showed up when I used the .. file name:

Learnings: 
A) Nothing new learnt as such but got a nice little recap of absolute and relative paths.

Step 1:
Firstly after reading the question I realized I had to read the /etc/passwd file, after that I decided to oopen the website.
Step 2:
In the website there was no particular inspection or websource which gave anything away as clues.
But it did have two scripts:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eddad0f-b7e7-4201-915b-30cd520a6367)
which implemented xml.
Decided to check out the hints which told me that an XML injection had been used as encryption here.
Step 3:
Decided to open burp suite intercept and tried to intercept the website.
In the interception I noticed that there was an xml implementation which consisted of an id=1,2,3 for different detail buttons for different types.
Step 4:
Then I honestly didnt know how to read the file required, took help from the web, used to port swigger website(mentioned in refernces).
Step 5:
Using that got to know what to and implemented that in burp.
Step 6:
I sent the data to the repeater and there I typed the following input and got the output(flag).
~~~
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>

  <data>
<ID>&xxe;
</ID></data>
~~~

Learnings:
A) Got to know about the XML Injection and how to implement in the website to read a file.
