# Binary Exploitation
## buffer overflow 0
## Flag

Step 1:
Before buffer overflow 0 I tried some easy challenges of binary exploitation such as heap 0.

Learnings
A) Now as I stated above before this I tried my hands on the easy challenges such as heap 0, so keeping the learnings which I learnt in heap 0 in mind, I tried this the same way.
Firstly I launched the instance as well as checked out the source code.
When the source code opened I saw that the string buf2 can only be maximum 16 characters and if I input more than 16 letters that data would overflow and the behaviour of the program would be manipulated and the flag might be printed.
That is exactly what happened here and the flag got printed when I entered a string with excessive letters.
B) Now this is how I related it to heap 0 and could do it so quickly, because in heap 0 i tried and tested alot and after checking out the source code I realized that in that as well after printing some choice I had to overflow the data so it could into the safe variable and print me the flag.
Other Methods
I only tried entering man gets, i dont know why I did that as that was given to me in the hint section but that wouldnt do anything as the man page cannot be printed out in this instance, everything else I learnt in heap 0.

## format string 0
## Flag
~~~
bash
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}
~~~

Step 1:
Same as the above question I had to check out the source code firstly and then I got to know that I had to input Gr%114d_Cheese which contains a format string %ll4d and is the only format string out of the 3 options.
Step 2:
That worked out and then I had to choose between 3 options again, and again only one string consisted of %s which is a string formatter and that worked and gave me the flag.

Learnings:
A) already knew about string formatters which were %lld and %s and using that concept got the flag.

watched the above video which didnt really have anything to do with the above challenge but still.


## heap 1

Flag

bash

Step 1:
In this challenge, just like heap 0, I opened the source code and the instance and this was just like heap 0.
But at first I didnt notice the difference between both and just tried what I did in heap 0 to obtain the flag.
Knowing that there would of course be some catch but still did it and it of course didnt work.
Step 2:
Went to the source code and carefully examined it.
That is when I saw it, the safe word shouldnt be pico or it wouldnt give me the flag.
Step 3:
So at first I entered all the alpha numeric characters to figure out which ones overflow to the safe var, once discovered that I entered such a string that would overflow pico to the safe var and give me the flag and it did.

Welcome to heap1!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5f7d1207b2b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5f7d1207b2d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 2
Data for buffer: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456pico

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)

Learnings:
A) nothing new learnt as such just a key takeaway to not straight dive into the question, instead taking a little time to read the source code and understand what the question actually requires.
