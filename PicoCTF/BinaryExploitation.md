# Binary Exploitation
## buffer overflow 0
## Flag
~~~
bash
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
~~~
Step 1:
Before buffer overflow 0 I tried some easy challenges of binary exploitation such as heap 0.

Learnings
A) Now as I stated above before this I tried my hands on the easy challenges such as heap 0, so keeping the learnings which I learnt in heap 0 in mind, I tried this the same way.
Firstly I launched the instance as well as checked out the source code.
When the source code opened I saw that the string buf2 can only be maximum 16 characters and if I input more than 16 letters that data would overflow and the behaviour of the program would be manipulated and the flag might be printed.
That is exactly what happened here and the flag got printed when I entered a string with excessive letters.
B) Now this is how I related it to heap 0 and could do it so quickly, because in heap 0 i tried and tested alot and after checking out the source code I realized that in that as well after printing some choice I had to overflow the data so it could into the safe variable and print me the flag.
Other Methods
I only tried entering man gets, i dont know why I did that as that was given to me in the hint section but that wouldnt do anything as the man page cannot be printed out in this instance, everything else I learnt in heap 0.

## format string 0
## Flag
~~~
bash
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}
~~~
Step 1:
Same as the above question I had to check out the source code firstly and then I got to know that I had to input Gr%114d_Cheese which contains a format string %ll4d and is the only format string out of the 3 options.
Step 2:
That worked out and then I had to choose between 3 options again and again only
