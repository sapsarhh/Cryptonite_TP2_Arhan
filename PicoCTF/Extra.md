picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}

Step 1:
This question was honestly very basic just went to the website and tried to inspect it and the page source.
Firstly didnt find anything so tried burpsuite, didnt find anything there as well.
Went back to the inspect element and tried to see the js code written, there I found a code and found an encoded base64 string which I decided to decode and got the flag.
